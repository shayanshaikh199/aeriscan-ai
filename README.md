# Aeriscan AI

Aeriscan AI is a full-stack medical imaging web application that analyzes chest X-ray images and predicts whether pneumonia is present.
The system provides a confidence score, risk level, and a visual explanation using Grad-CAM heatmaps to show which regions of the image most influenced the model’s prediction.


# Features

Upload chest X-ray images through a clean, stylish UI

AI model predicts Pneumonia vs Normal

Confidence score with animated progress bar

Risk level classification (Low / Moderate / High)

Grad-CAM heatmap overlay for visual explainability

Red heatmap for pneumonia predictions

Green heatmap for normal predictions

Professional hover tooltip explaining heatmap meaning

FastAPI backend with interactive Swagger documentation

Fully responsive React + TypeScript frontend

# How It Works

The user uploads a chest X-ray image

The image is sent to the FastAPI backend

A trained PyTorch CNN processes the image

# The model:

Predicts the class (Pneumonia or Normal)

Calculates a confidence score

Generates a Grad-CAM heatmap

The frontend overlays the heatmap on the X-ray and displays the results in real time.

# Heatmap Explanation

Red overlay → Model detected features consistent with pneumonia

Green overlay → Model detected features consistent with normal lungs

Heatmaps highlight regions the model focused on, not exact pathology

Hover over the image to view an explanatory tooltip
